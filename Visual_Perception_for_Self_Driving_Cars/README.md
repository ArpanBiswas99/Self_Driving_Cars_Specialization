# Course 3 on Self Driving Cars
This course explains visual perception stack of self driving cars by analyzing basic pinhole camera model and its associated rotation and translation matrix calculations for converrting 3D world frame to 2D image frame. 
Image feature detection techniques, decription matching and outlier rejection methods for continuous image based localization. Implemented OpenCV libraries of SIFT, SURF, ORB, FAST methods for image feature detection between two subsequent images along with Brute Force (BF) and FLANN based image matching. 

Topics covered include:
- Hardware and software architectures for self-driving vehicles
- Camera model and calibration
- Feature detection, description, and matching
- Convolutional neural networks for 2D object detection and semantic segmentation
