# Course 2 on Self Driving Cars
This course explains localization and state estimation of Self Driving Cars with application of Kalman Filters. Designing state estimation pipeline using error state kalman filter and fused sensor data from IMU, Wheel speed, GPS, and Lidar. To avoid non-linearity in the estimated state unscented kalman filter or particle filter can be implemented.

Topics covered include:
- Hardware and software architectures for self-driving vehicles
- State estimation with linear and nonlinear Kalman filters
- LIDAR/GNSS/IMU sensor fusion for localization
